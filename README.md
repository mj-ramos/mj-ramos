## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maria and welcome to my GitHub page :smile:  
I'm from Braga, Portugal, and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at University of Minho.    


## Things about me :woman:
- I volunteer at ABRA, a non-profit organization that helps dogs and cats
- My hobbies include watching movies/series, reading and listening to music
- I like to work with clay and soon I will open an online shop
 
## Coding :desktop_computer:	
My favorite coding languages are Java, C and Python.  
I don't have many public projects because I'm a perfectionist, and I don't want things that I'm not that proud of represent me. Soon I'll be adding more projects.
